# Retrieving temporary AWS credentials using Cognito
## Introduction
This binary authenticates a user against Cognito to get a set of temporary credentials. Before using, update the constants in `main.go` with the appropriate values and recompile the binary. 
## TODO 
Create a makefile that creates the binary automatically from values specified from the command line.
